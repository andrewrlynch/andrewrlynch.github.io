Because I'll be moving my blog from [*The Bioconjugate*](https://bioconjugate.blog) to this page, I thought I would leave a trail of breadcrumbs to posts from the old blog for a little while. I'm not sure when of if I'll shut that space down completely, but most of my online presence will be switching to this space.
