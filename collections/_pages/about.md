## Now

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at in the [Cancer Genomics and Evolution (Van Loo) Laboratory](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/van-loo-laboratory.html) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. I apply genomics approaches to study how tumors evolve and identify its weaknesses.

## Then

I earned my Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Pathology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison where I developed [novel methods]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/CINFER) to quantify chromosomal instability in tumors. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.
