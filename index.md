I do cancer genomics and study tumor evolution, instability, and plasticity to advance precision medicine. 

I'm currently a postdoc in the Cancer Genomics and Evolution Laboratory at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and hold a TRIUMPH fellowship from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.
