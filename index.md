I do cancer genomics and study tumor evolution, instability, and plasticity to advance precision medicine. 

I'm currently a postdoc in the Cancer Genomics and Evolution Laboratory at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and hold fellowships from the National Cancer Institute and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.
